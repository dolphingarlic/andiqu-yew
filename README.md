# Andi Qu - The Website
**Now (almost) truly a JavaScript-free zone!**

I like a lot of things, but one thing I really dislike is J\*v\*Scr\*pt. That's why I decided to remake my personal website with as little JS as possible!

I achieved this by mainly using Rust and WebAssembly (but unfortunately, one cannot completely escape JS in modern web development... for now.)
